                <article>
                    Lord <strong>Shri Krishna</strong> has a revered place in Hinduism. But he is more than that for me.
                    His knowledge
                    which he gave Kurukshetra to Arjuna. The knowledge that can completely change life. Your outlook
                    towards life can change. The teachings of<strong>Shri Krishna</strong> which are mentioned in
                    Shrimad Bhagwat. Even
                    today he is no less than a treasure. India and its invaluable wealth. Which can never be lost or
                    stolen. It is a great thing to know and understand the teachings of<strong>Shri Krishna</strong>.
                    Today not only
                    India but the whole world appreciates the teachings of Shrimad Bhagwat Geeta and considers Shri
                    Krishna to be revered. And today the knowledge of <strong>Shrimad Bhagwat</strong> is given in every
                    country of the
                    world.

                <h2>Kautilya Pandit(chanakya)</h2>
                <article>
                    Kautilya Pandit is known as <strong> Chanakya</strong>. He was a true gem of Indian history.
                    Chanakya was a teacher of
                    political science by profession. Who used to teach in Taxila Gurukul (now this Gurukul(University)
                    is in
                    Afghanistan). Chanakya has given India to great emperors like Chandragupta Maurya and Chakravarti
                    Ashoka. For me he is ideal. Because he had taken a vow to destroy the great empire for the welfare
                    of the people alone. And took a resolution that we will make India a united India. He fulfilled his
                    resolve and extended the border of India from present day Afghanistan to Myanmar. With his knowledge
                    and wisdom, he saved India from external invaders like <strong>Alexander</strong> without any army
                    and also prevented
                    the massacre in India, his philosophy and knowledge are still included in India's diplomacy.<br>
                    India is not a ordinary country. India is the land of many knowledgeable ,Mahatmas, saints and
                    heroes. Who
                    has made not only India but entire humanity proud.

                <h2>Ratan Tata</h2>
                <article>
                    <strong>Ratan Tata</strong> is a big industrialist of India. He is the former chairman of Tata
                    Group. I see him as a
                    successful business man. The special thing about mr. <strong>Ratan Tata</strong> is this. That they
                    know how to take
                    decisions, whether it is
                    to acquire JLR(Jaguar land rover) or acquire chorus Steel. His bold move made the Tata group a $123
                    billion company.
                    . also I see a kind patriotic person in him. A person who works for humanity.
                    When there was a terrorist attack in India, He had presented a new example of humanity.
                    In this tough Time of covid-19 pandemic he helps Indian government to overcome the situation .
                    <strong>Ratan Tata</strong> is a big philanthropist not only of India but of the world. Ratan Tata
                    believes in simple
                    living which makes
                    his personality great. he respects every person associated with the company.<br>

                <h2>Steve Jobs</h2>
                <article>What should I write about <strong>Steve Jobs</strong> . because I can't explain his personality
                    in just few
                    words.<strong>Steve Jobs</strong> was a visionary leader who built the world's biggest company
                    Apple.inc | His
                    philosophy, his vision, his way of thinking impresses me a lot. I always follow him and will
                    continue to do so. If there were no <strong>Steve Jobs</strong>, then perhaps the technology would
                    have been a bit
                    complicated. His teachings are always in my mind. And I also use their lessons. He believed that
                    more complexity is useless. So I made my website very simple, I have designed this website according
                    to them.<br>
